          <ul>
            <li>★ George Washington Carver (c. 1864[1] – January 5, 1943) was an American agricultural scientist and inventor who promoted alternative crops to cotton and methods to prevent soil depletion.[2] He was one of the most prominent black scientists of the early 20th century.</li>
            <li>★  He was the first black student and taught as the first black faculty member at Iowa State. </li>
            <li>★ Though he did not have an earned doctorate, both Simpson College and Selma University awarded him honorary doctorates of science in his lifetime.</li>
            <li>★ In 1896, Booker T. Washington, the first principal and president of the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), invited Carver to head its Agriculture Department.[3] Carver taught there for 47 years, developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure.</li>
            <li>★ Carver wasn’t a strong child and could not work in the fields which forced him to help with household chores and gardening. Through many hours of exploration around his home, Carver grew a strong interest in plants later becoming nicknamed “the plant doctor.” </li>
            <li>★ Dr. Carver established an agriculture extension in Alabama and founded an industrial research lab where he worked tirelessly on the development of hundreds of applications for new plants. Carver discovered more than 300 uses for peanuts and hundreds more uses for soybeans, pecans and sweet potatoes.</li>
            <li>★ According to the National Peanut Board, Dr. Carver published the research bulletin, "How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it For Human Consumption.</li>
            <li>★  Carver was the first Black scientist to be memorialized in a national monument, which was erected near his birthplace in Diamond Grove, Missouri.</li>
